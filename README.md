# Pharmacokinetics CMPU250
The code in this repository should be used for educational purposes only as the coefficients are arbitrary and the simulations make many simplifying assumptions.

The included MATLAB file contains a script that compares two different methods of computing the concentration of drug in a person's blood after a given amount of time in hours.  Namely, the methods are using a more discretized approach or tabular method versus an entirely analytical solution.

This script was initially created to aid in discussion in Vassar College's CMPU250 class.  The code was written in MATLAB_R2017B and requires the Symbolic Math add-on.

See my write-up [here](CMPU250_Drug_Absorbtion.pdf).
